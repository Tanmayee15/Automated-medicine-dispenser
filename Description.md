This project reconfigures conventional pill bottles into an automatic pill reminder and dispenser. Utilizing a simple microcontroller, we have developed a model of an automated pill reminder system that adheres to a prescribed administration schedule. This system is designed for ease of operation and usability, providing an effective solution for medication management.

Features
Automated Scheduling: The device uses a microcontroller to keep track of when a patient should take their medication.
LCD Display: Displays the time for the next scheduled medication intake.
Reminder Alerts: Generates repeated messages when it's time to take medication.
LED Indication: Blinking LEDs indicate which compartment to open for the correct medication.
User-Friendly: Designed for ease of use, ensuring patients can manage their medication effectively.

Components
Microcontroller: Core component for tracking medication schedules and controlling alerts.
LCD Screen: Displays the next medication time and other relevant information.
LED Indicators: Provide visual cues for the correct medication compartment.
Pill Compartments: Separate sections for different medications, each associated with an LED indicator.

How It Works
Setup: The patient or caregiver sets the medication schedule into the microcontroller.
Display: The next medication time is shown on the LCD screen.
Reminder: When it's time to take a medication, the system generates a reminder message and activates the corresponding LED indicator.
Dispensing: The patient opens the indicated compartment to take their medication.
Repeat: The process repeats according to the schedule, ensuring timely medication intake.

Benefits
Reduces Human Error: Minimizes the risk of taking incorrect dosages or missing doses.
Enhances Compliance: Helps patients adhere to their prescribed medication schedules.
Improves Health Outcomes: Ensures consistent and accurate medication intake, leading to better health management.
Cost-Effective: Reduces the need for constant human supervision and monitoring.
